Ingredients

300g Diced Potato
300g Diced Carrot
300g Sliced Onion
1 Large Apple (Diced obviously)
300ml Tomato Juice
750ml Vegetable Stock/Swiss Veg Bouillon (is what I use)
3 Cloves Garlic (crushed or grated)
2 Tbsp Hot Madras Curry Powder (or if you like less spice equivalent of mild / medium)
2 Tsp Smoked Spanish Paprika â€“ Optional
2 Tbsp Olive Oil

Method
Dice the potato (1 cm cubes) and slice onion and fry on a medium heat. You want the potato to start to stick to the bottom of the pan a little and onions to soften. Now add in the diced carrots and apple and cook for a further 3-4 minutes. Now mix in the Garlic and the curry powder and paprika (if you are using it). Still for 2-3 minutes stirring and coating all the veg. Now add in the tomato juice and stock and bring to the boil. Once boiling reduce to a simmer for 30 mins.
After 30 mins remove the soup from the heat and cook for 5-10 mins and then blend until completely puree. Depending on how thick you like your soup you can add boiling water to dilute to taste. 
Go swanky and add a few croutons and a drizzle some olive oil on each portion. In summer nice as a Indian Gazpacho.
