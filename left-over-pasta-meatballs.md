# _Meat_balls From Left Over Pasta

I usually have a load of left over pasta and this is a decent way to get rid of it/reuse it without just throwing it away. If you crisp them up decently it turns out alright, obviously not as good as meatballs but if you're not into meat then you probably don't care.

## Ingredients 

- 250g wholewheat pasta shapes 
- 400g tin black beans
- 50g sun-dried tomatoes in oil
- 1 tablespoon of chilli powder (I use the indian one because I like the heat)
- 50ml BBQ sauce (doesn't matter what type _really_)
- usual bit of olive oil
- 1 large onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- _seasoning_

## Method

1. Throw all the pasta in a blender or food processor if you're fancy with the beans, bbq sauce, tomato puree, pepper and salt
2. Blend/Food Process until it's a decently sticky mixture.
3. Get a pan out and put some olive oil and the large onion. Cook it until it looks good then throw it in the bowl with the rest of the mixture.
4. Roll the mixture into small meatball sized balls and cook on a decent temperature until they're crispy and noice.

All rights to them and you could probably watch the ITV series the produced where they (demonstrate cooking this)[https://www.itv.com/hub/living-on-the-veg/2a7939a0009] because it's a better guide than this. I obviously wrote the method, theirs is better and more imformative.
